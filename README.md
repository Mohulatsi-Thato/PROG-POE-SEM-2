📌 Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)
📖 Project Overview

The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is a GUI-only prototype designed to simplify the monthly claim process for contract lecturers. The system allows lecturers to create and submit claims, upload supporting documents, and track their claim status. Managers can review, approve, or reject claims through a user-friendly dashboard.

⚠️ Note: This is a prototype — functionality is limited to front-end design with no back-end integration.
